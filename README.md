# Brief description:
Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and follicular lymphomas (FL) are two B-cell lineage malignancies that have very different clinical presentations,
natural histories and response to therapy. However, FLs frequently evolve over time and acquire the morphologic and clinical features of DLBCLs and some
subsets of DLBCLs have chromosomal translocations characteristic of FLs. The gene-expression based classification model was built to distinguish between
these two lymphomas.
